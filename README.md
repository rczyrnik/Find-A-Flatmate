# Flatmate Finder

_I explored the way users interacted on an app-based roommate matching platform._

### Introduction
I partnered with an app-based roommate matching platform to investigate what factors influence whether a user can find a roommate through their app. Because the app doesn't follow up with sers to find which have successfully matched through the app, they define success as two users starting a conversation through the in-platform messaging service. 

I developed a model that more effectively identifies whether a particular user will respond to a message. With this model, the platform can be more selective in recommending possible matches.

### The Data Set
The data set included 25,000 users who sent over 30,000 messages.

The user data included 50 columns of data, including basic demographic information and roommate preferences. The message data was grouped into conversations, and included the time, users, and text of the message.
